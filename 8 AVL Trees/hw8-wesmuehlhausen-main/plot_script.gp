# This is an example gnuplot script to generate a basic performance
# comparison graph for CPSC 223. This example requires an "out.dat"
# file, which was generated by running:
#
#     ./hw6perf 1 > out.dat
#
# To run this script type the following at the command line
#
#     gnuplot -c plot_script.gp infile testname outfile
#
# For example, to create the output for the add to end test above, run
# the following from the command line
#
#     gnuplot -c plot_script.gp "out.dat" "Add" "add.png"
#
